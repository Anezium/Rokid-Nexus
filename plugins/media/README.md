# Media Deck

Media Deck is the Rokid Nexus universal now-playing plugin. Playback remains owned by
the active Android media app; the plugin reads its `MediaSession`, sends a declarative
HUD surface, and forwards only play/pause/previous/next transport commands.

## Module boundary

- No CXR, Bluetooth, glasses SDK, phone-hub implementation, microphone, or network
  dependency.
- The plugin owns its notification-listener component and its `MediaDeckSettingsActivity`
  on the shared NexusUi kit.
- `MediaDeckPluginService` registers the headless APK through the external Nexus plugin
  SDK and adapts the isolated `MediaDeckRuntime` onto typed surface sessions.
- The glasses hub owns rendering through the versioned `media` surface documented in
  `../BUSSPEC.md`; the plugin never installs or launches glasses-side code.

## HUD contract

- Swipe back/forward: previous/next media item.
- Tap/center: play or pause.
- Back: close Media Deck and return to the underlying glasses app.
- Position advances locally from an anchor; the phone does not poll or stream
  progress updates.
- Artwork is center-cropped, contrast-normalized, Floyd-Steinberg dithered, and packed
  as a 96 x 96 one-bit mask. The original bitmap never crosses the Nexus bus.

Media titles and artwork are user data. They may be rendered on the requested HUD but
must not be included in production logs.
